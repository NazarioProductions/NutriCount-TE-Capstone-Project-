My team developed a web app for our course project. It helps users track weight and calories. We used an external API for food calories, letting users group items into meals. Users made profiles with avatars and earned stars for daily weight input. I led front-end tasks, designing UI, the logo, and writing JavaScript/CSS/Vue code. My partners added the API and Java-based back-end endpoints. These endpoints managed JSON data in an SQL database, storing user meals, profiles, login details, and daily weight.
